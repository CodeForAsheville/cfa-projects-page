# Code for Asheville Projects Page

This simple page reads a list of project titles, descriptions, links and optional images from a Google Sheet to create a project page listing for use on the Code for Asheville website. The purpose of the page is to let interested members see what the brigade is working on and follow the links to any projects they would like to participate in (i.e., the link should lead to a place where someone can find out how to contribute).

The projects sheet is at [CFA_Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JxjCN4Nf8P8KEdVkvyuAo9fgbkKTC91PP39dC5JvYv0/edit?usp=sharing) and is published to the web.
